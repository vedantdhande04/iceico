➡️try catch is used to try the code block once and if
error occurs , it does not stop the execution but
runs the catch block and error is logged
try{

}
catch(err){
    console.log(err)
}


➡️promises are used to run block codes parallely , 
a promise promises fullfillment of the code by either resolving or rejecting
let promise = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{

})

promise.then((value)=>{
    console.log(value)
})
promise.catch((error)=>{
    console.log(error)
})

➡️any function can be made async and then a promise can be awaited inside it
async function Name () {
    x = iski value promise 5 second baad dega
    y = iski value promise 10 second baad dega

    let xvalue = await x; //ye wait krta rahega and execution
    idhr hi ruka dega jab tak value nahi aati 

    let yvalue = await y;
}


➡️fetch() is used for fetching a resource from a server
it is a method that returns a promise and resolves into a response object


➡️map() 
it is a method used to perform a action or function on 
elements of an existing array and creating a new array which 
contains the resultant elements of the function

let x = [1,2,3,4]
let newArr = x.map(Math.sqr)

or 

let totens = (num)=>{
    return num*10;
}
let newArr = x.map(totens);


➡️reduce()
array method
reduces a array to a single value depending on the function execution
