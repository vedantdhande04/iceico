Things to remember
    1)always calculate TC in the terms of worst case
    2)ignore constant values
    3)ignore lower bounnd values

Different types of TC

    Big-oh(O) => worst case[upper bound]
    Theta => Average case
    Omega => Best case [lower bound]

Example-1
    if there are two nested for loops
    then for time complexity

    for (i loop range 1 to N)
        for (j loop range 1 to N)

    for each time i loop runs , the j loop runs N time
    therefore , we can say that if i loop runs 5 times , then 
    time complexity will be 5N
    but we can also say that 
    it  is N*N , therefore 
    time complexity will be O(N^2)


Example-2

    if 
    1+2+3+4....5N
    then 

    simplified => N(N+1)/2
