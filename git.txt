git kraken - best GUI tool

Why command line?
GUI tool have limitations
GUI tools not always available

First the changed code goes to the staging area for review
if everything is correct , we commit


➡️ Commands

    git config --global -e 
    git config --global core.autocrlf true //for windows

    git add => for staging
    git commit => commmit

    git commit -m "a message"  => used to commit only staged files
    git commit -a  => commit all files without staging
    git commit -am "a message"  => commit all files with a message

    best practice is to first stage then commit

    git rm file.txt => to remove/delete a file
    git mv file1 file2 => rename file1 to file2

    git init


    make a .gitignore file to deny tracking of files by git (make sure it is in root)
    ex- if a directory named "logs" is to be not tracked then 
        add "logs/" in .gitignore

    git rm -cached filename  => removes from staging area
    git rm -h => help related to rm command

    git diff --staged => compares line changes between commited and staged
    git diff => compars line chnages between working directory and staged

    we can also configure a difftool , such as vscode


    git restore --staged filename  => to unstage a file


    git restore filename => will undo all the local changes


    git restore --source=HEAD~1 file.txt  => restores the file from a commit before the last commit
    for ex = if you delete the file by mistake
