git kraken - best GUI tool

Why command line?
GUI tool have limitations
GUI tools not always available

First the changed code goes to the staging area for review
if everything is correct , we commit


➡️ Commands

    git config --global -e 
    git config --global core.autocrlf true //for windows

    git add => for staging
    git commit => commmit

    git commit -m "a message"  => used to commit only staged files
    git commit -a  => commit all files without staging
    git commit -am "a message"  => commit all files with a message

    best practice is to first stage then commit

    git rm file.txt => to remove/delete a file
    git mv file1 file2 => rename file1 to file2

    git init


    make a .gitignore file to deny tracking of files by git (make sure it is in root)
    ex- if a directory named "logs" is to be not tracked then 
        add "logs/" in .gitignore
