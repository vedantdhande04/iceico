display grid practice , with the area property

made a responsive structure of a web page with grid

tips for responsiveness
1 use relative padding - padding:min(5em , 8%); 
    this selects the padding which is minimum

2 use responsive font size
    clamp function : 
        font-size : clamp (1.8rem , calc(7vw+1rem) , 5rem)
                            min , preferred and max
            the example given is for the headings , the calc function
            is used to keep the header responsive to user  zooming in
            and out .

3 responsive images
    aspect-ratio : 9/16;
    object-fit : cover ;

4 dynamic viewport height
    100vh might not work on some deviced , so use
    height : 100dvh

flexbox tools

flex-wrap : wrap;
flex-shrink: 0 or 1; like a boolean value , can be greater than 1 too
flex-grow: 0 or 1; like a boolean value , can be greater than 1 too

for logo  - use margin-right:auto

    while other navnar elements are - justify-content:flex-end;



we can use grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
    for the navbar and content so that the navbar stays 200px



implicit grids
    this property is used to handle the dynamic sizing of the elements
    when new elements are added , 
    grid-auto-rows:300px

    changes the elements which are added to 300px height


horizontal scroller
    new items added horizontally
    grid-auto-columns:300px;
    grid-auto-flow:column;   #the default flow is row

define grid area in html
    style="grid-area : box-1"
    style="grid-area : box-2"
