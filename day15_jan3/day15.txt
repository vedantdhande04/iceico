In react we can have three types of styles

1 . External
    same as normal external styles

2. modules   - for individual components
    in this we make a folder for each component
    inside that a dedicated ss for the component with naming convention 
    as componentName.module.css

3. internal  - for smaller components
    const styles ={

    }

    then style ={styles}



props- read only properties that are shared between components
    a parent can send prop to its child
