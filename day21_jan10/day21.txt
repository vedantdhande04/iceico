Why Learn React?
Before React, front-end development struggled with:

Manual DOM Manipulation: Traditional JavaScript directly modified the DOM, slowing down the performance.
Complex State Management: Maintaining UI state became messy and hard to debug.
Tight Coupling in Frameworks: Frameworks like Angular introduced complex two-way data binding that made code harder to manage



React uses Babel (a compiler) to convert JSX into pure JavaScript.
